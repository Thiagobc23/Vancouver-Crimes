# Vancouver-Crimes
  
### Motivation
This project was build with the intention of learning more about data visualization, specifically maps and animations.
  
### Data
The main dataset used was Vancouver crimes which contains data on the incidents that happened between 2003 and now.  
As informed in the source:  
    This is a dataset of crime data on a year-by-year basis beginning in 2003.

    Legal Disclaimer from Vancouver Police Department

    The release of Vancouver Police Department (VPD) crime data is intended to 
    enhance community awareness of policing activity in Vancouver. Users are 
    cautioned not to rely on the information provided to make decisions about 
    the specific safety level of a specific location or area. By using this data 
    the user agrees and understands that neither the Vancouver Police Department, 
    Vancouver Police Board nor the City of Vancouver assumes liability for any 
    decisions made or actions taken or not taken by the user in reliance upon 
    any information or data provided.

    While every effort has been made to be transparent in this process, users 
    should be aware that this data is designed to provide individuals with a 
    general overview of incidents falling into several crime categories. The 
    information provided therefore does not reflect the total number of calls 
    or complaints made to the VPD. Please refer to the FAQ for further details. 
    The data provided is based upon information contained in the VPD Records 
    Management System. The crime classification and file status may change at 
    any time based on the dynamic nature of police investigations. The VPD has 
    taken great care to protect the privacy of all parties involved in the 
    incidents reported. No personal or identifying information has been provided 
    in the data. Locations for reported incidents involving Offences Against a 
    Person have been deliberately randomized to several blocks and offset to an 
    intersection. No time or street location name will be provided for these 
    offences. For property related offences, the VPD has provided the location 
    to the hundred block of these incidents within the general area of the block. 
    All data must be considered offset and users should not interpret any locations 
    as related to a specific person or specific property.
